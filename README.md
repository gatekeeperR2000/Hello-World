# Overview

This is a basic Hello World? program to check that my IDE and GitHub software are set up correctly. It will put the words "Hello World!" to the screen if Python has been installed on the device.

Found below is a video demonstration. this video serves a similar purpose of making sure that videos and links will work for future projects.

# Development Environment

For this project I set up Visual Studio Code as my IDE. This includes getting the Python and Pylance extensions and downloading Python onto my device. I also had to download and set up GitHub and Git.

For this project I used on of the first languages I ever learned Python. It is a simpler language for newer programmers to learn, with syntax that is closer to English. For this project to set things up and create a baseline I felt that Python would serve a decent job to accomplish my goals.

# Useful Websites

For this project it was simple enough I did not use any webisites for help. Python was installed with the VS Code terminal, and Youtube and GitHub I got help from some freinds and a teacher. In future projects this section will include links to websites that I used to help learn and create the content in the future.
